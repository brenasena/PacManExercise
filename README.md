# PacManExercise
Project Description: This project creates a Pac Man that moves across the computer screen. It utilizes boundary criteria to determine when the Pac Man should turn around once it hits the side of the screen. It also considers a particular speed of movement across the screen.

How to run: You can run this animation by downloading the index.html file/code and dragging it into a browser window. You can also branch the code provided here to one of your on-going projects.

Roadmap of future improvements:
For future improvements I plan to add a button which adds additional Pac-Mans which move simultaneously across the screen. I will also play around with the speed and timing of each Pac Man so that some move faster and some move slower.
